# MSU Helper

An app to provide useful utilities for MSU students!

Check this app out [on the Google Play store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.frozor.msuhelper) While iOS is supported, it's not currently planned because I don't have a Mac or the urge to pay $100 a year.

Current features:

* Food truck locations/times
* Movie night locations/times
* Google maps integration
* An overcomplicated equation to determine priority of a given event

Planned features:

* Movie information (like ratings, description, etc.)
* Google calendar integration
* Dining hall hours (and potentially menus)
